# SQL Support

Since Version 2.7.1 the driver supports [SQL queries](queryholder.md) on MongoDB. The SQL queries are converted to MongoDB queries and could executed on the MongoDB database. 

The driver also supports a [JDBC driver](jdbc-driver.md) to use the SQL queries in your application and migrate your database with liquibase for example.
